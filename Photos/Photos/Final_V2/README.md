# Final Prosthesis â€” Improved Version (V2)

This folder documents the **final version** of the prosthesis, built for **Manon Smesman**.

## Description
- Improved print quality and materials.
- Printed in **PLA (or PETG)** for higher dimensional accuracy and smoother surface.
- Enhanced assembly process following prototype validation.

## Improvements compared to V1
| Aspect | V1 (Prototype) | V2 (Final) |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| Material | ABS | PLA (or PETG) |
| Print quality | Visible layer shifts, minor warping | Stable, high-quality prints |
| Fit and tolerance | Manual adjustment required | Accurate fits from slicer optimization |
| Assembly | Experimental | Optimized sequence, smoother hinge motion |
