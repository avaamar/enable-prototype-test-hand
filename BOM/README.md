## 1. Non-Printable Materials

| Category | Material | Description / Notes |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Elastic** | Elastic cord | 1 mm or 2 mm diameter elastic cord for tendon return. About 50 cm per device. Preferred in warm regions where dental elastics are difficult to source. |
| **Dental elastics** | Orthodontic elastic bands | Used on Phoenix / Raptor / UnLimbited hands. Typically sizes 3/8" or 1/4" (force range 95 – 135 %). |
| **Screws** | Stainless-steel M3 screws | Used to adjust tendon tension and fix parts. Prefer cross-head stainless screws with rounded or conical heads. For a 100 %-scale hand, 6 mm to 8 mm long M3 screws are suitable. |
| **Nylon fishing line** | Tendon cable | Non-elastic nylon line (0.4 – 0.6 mm diameter). Used for flexion tendons. Available in the fishing or beading section. |
| **Crimp beads or tubes** | Cable terminations | Used to secure the ends of nylon tendons. Insert the line, crimp with pliers. Found in jewellery or fishing sections. |
| **Plasti-Dip** | Finger coating | Applied to fingertips to provide grip. Substitute for silicone finger caps. |
| **Foam** | Soft padding | 2 mm – 5 mm thick foam to protect the user’s skin or the test surface. EVA or similar. |
| **Velcro straps** | Attachment straps | 1 m of 25 mm wide hook-and-loop (Velcro). One side sewn or glued to the arm brace. |
| **Misc. hardware** | Heat-set inserts | M3 inserts installed with a soldering iron. |
